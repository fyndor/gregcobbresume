    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a Software Engineer with more than 18 years of professional experience developing full stack 
      web and desktop applications. I have a proven track record of implementing highly performant code 
      that is easy to maintain and understand, while meeting the needs of the customers and reducing the 
      costs to our business. I like automating repetitive and error prone tasks to improve developer 
      workflow and improving release pipeline. I enjoy taking poorly performing code and database queries 
      and achieving massive speed improvements. Hyper focused on UX designs where users can get things 
      done quickly in an intuitive way. I am eager and capable of learning new technologies quickly, and 
      I am continuously seeking to improve my craft. </p>
